## Familiarity with the do,while and switch commands
Full description about **vector** in [Vector](https://github.com/MhyrAskri/Vector)

Use **do,while** to create a loop that runs once before checking the condition.

Use **switch** to facilitate and reduce the number of if and esle ifs and make the program lighter to run.

Use the **empty()** command in the vector to check if the vector is empty or not.

Use the **auto** access modifier to allow the program to detect the type of variable inside the vector in the **for (auto number : numbers)** command.

Create an infinite while loop to receive a number from the user on line 57 of the program and place the number in the vector with the **push_back()** command. In this loop, the exit is in the hands of the user, so that if the user enters the number -1, the condition of the loop becomes **false** and the program exits the loop.
